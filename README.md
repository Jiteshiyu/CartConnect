## Demo

You can view a live demo of the project [CartConnect](https://cartconnect.netlify.app/).

## Features

- Browse products from a sample store.
- Add or remove products from the shopping cart.
- View cart summary and total amount.
- Responsive design for optimal viewing on various devices.

## Technologies Used

- React (for building the UI)
- Redux Toolkit (for state management)
- Tailwind CSS (for styling)
- Fake Store API (for fetching product data)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the project locally:

### Prerequisites

Ensure that **Node.js** and **npm** are installed on your machine. If not, you can download them from [here](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Jiteshiyu/CartConnect.git
   cd CartConnect
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see the app in action.

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev`: Start the development server.
- `npm run build`: Build the app for production.
- `npm run preview`: Preview the production build locally.

## How It Works

The CartConnect app uses an external API to fetch and display product data.

1. **Fetching Product Data:** The app sends a GET request to the Fake Store API, retrieving data such as product names, prices, and images.
2. **Cart Functionality:** Users can add products to their cart and remove them as needed.
3. **Displaying Data:** The app shows a list of products and allows users to manage their shopping cart.
4. **Responsive Design:** The layout adjusts for different screen sizes using Tailwind CSS.

## Future Improvements

- Add user authentication for a personalized shopping experience.
- Implement a search functionality to find products more easily.
- Improve the user interface with additional animations and graphics.
- Add error handling for failed API requests.

## Challenges and Learnings

- **State Management:** Utilizing Redux Toolkit for state management helped streamline the data flow throughout the app.
- **API Integration:** Integrating the Fake Store API required handling asynchronous requests effectively.
- **Responsive Design:** Ensuring a responsive layout across devices required careful use of Tailwind CSS utilities.
